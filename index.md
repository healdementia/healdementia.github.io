I am a frontend developer. I `<3` what I do.<br>
Currently I'm working at [Piano](https://piano.io). What I like the most about my job is that I'm crafting things people will use. I like thinking about how they'd do it, and making their trip as comfortable and joyful as I can, and [here's why](/why).

<h3>Thoughts on the web, the life, the love</h3>

From time to time I write here what I'm concerned about.

- [Frontend dev SVG toolkit. Pt. I](/frontend-dev-svg-toolkit)
- [Frontend dev SVG toolkit. Pt. II](/frontend-dev-svg-toolkit-pt-2)
- [A forgotten thing about the accessibility which matters](/a-forgotten-thing-about-the-accessibility-which-matters)
- [Codevember 2018 for the first time. A waste or a priceless gift?](/codevember-2018)

<h3>Get in touch</h3>

If you have something to say. If you want to see what I do. If you're simply curious. Feel free. Always.
